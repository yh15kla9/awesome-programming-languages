  - You can also build your program to a standalone executable. In either case, you don't need a build system.
  - You can directly call C functions.
  - Data is garbage collected. Don't worry about what's by-reference or by-value.
  - Crow is statically typed. There's no subtyping or implicit conversion. There are no null references. Overload resolution is unambiguous.
  - I/O is controlled. Normal functions can't do I/O except by invoking a lambda from a parameter.
  - You can launch parallel tasks and get the result as a future.

  - Syntax is expression-based. Function bodies are expressions with no return needed.
  - Even if and for are expressions.
  - Code is flat. Most declarations are not nested inside of anything.
  - Expressions are type-checked with an expected type. The same syntax like (1, 2) could be a list, tuple, vector, etc. This saves you from having to write new Foo().
  - There are discriminated unions, including option types.
  - There are templates; these are type-checked abstractly, not at each instantiation.
  - All crow code goes in modules. There are no global declarations.
- [Crumb](https://github.com/liam-ilan/crumb) - Crumb is a high level, functional, interpreted, dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language, with a terse syntax, and a verbose standard library.

The purpose of the project is to engineer modern language features into C in an evolutionary rather than revolutionary way. Java is an example of the revolutionary approach of modernizing C/C++, resulting in a new language rather than an extension of its descendents. C++, Fortran 95 and Cobol 9X are examples of the evolutionary approach where modern language features are added and problems fixed within the framework of an existing language.

EEL has dynamic typing, automatic memory management, exception handling and built-in high level data types such as vectors, arrays and tables. New such data types can be added at run time by host applications. EEL compiles into byte-code that runs on a virtual machine, which means that no explicit support for specific architectures is needed for portability.

- [Ivy](https://github.com/jhallen/ivy-lang) - Ivy is an extensible, dynamically typed, late binding language intended to be used as an embedded command language. It can also be used stand-alone: it can execute script files from the command line or presents a read-eval-print loop (REPL) to the user if no files are given. Ivy's extensibility is based on the fact that statements are syntactically identical to function calls. Also blocks (surrounded by braces) may be used as function arguments. Thus, new user-defined statements can be added just by defining functions. Function arguments are packaged up as thunks and may have their evaluation delayed and execution environment modified. This allows user defined functions to do many of the things that traditional language statements can do.

- [JMatch](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/jmatch/) - The JMatch language extends Java with pattern matching that supports both data abstraction and iteration abstraction. Patterns are not tied to algebraic data constructors as in ML; instead, a single JMatch method may be used in several modes, some of which can serve as patterns. JMatch provides modal abstraction that simplifies the specification and implementation of abstract data types. These modes that may share a common implementation as a boolean formula. Thus, the specification, implementation, and use of iteration abstractions are made convenient, by automatically finding multiple solutions to a formula or pattern.
- [Jolie](https://www.jolie-lang.org/) - Jolie crystallises the programming concepts of service-oriented computing as linguistic constructs. The basic building blocks of software are not objects or functions, but rather services that can be relocated and replicated as needed. A composition of services is a service. 
- [Joy](https://hypercubed.github.io/joy/joy.html) - The language Joy is a purely functional programming language. Whereas all other functional programming languages are based on the application of functions to arguments, Joy is based on the composition of functions. All such functions take a stack as argument and produce a stack as value. Consequently much of Joy looks like ordinary postfix notation. However, in Joy a function can consume any number of parameters from the stack and leave any number of results on the stack. The concatenation of appropriate programs denotes the composition of the functions which the programs denote. One of the datatypes of Joy is that of quoted programs, of which lists are a special case. Some functions expect quoted programs on top of the stack and execute them in many different ways, effectively by dequoting.

The compiler also automatically converts inefficient copy-and-update operations into in-place destructive operations. Mars also has some other nice features borrowed from functional programming: a strong static type system, algebraic data types, pattern-matching switch statements, and higher-order functions. Mars is an experiment, not a full-featured programming language. You can use it for playing with the boundaries between imperative and declarative programming, but we don't recommend you write real software with it.

- [MLF](https://www.pearltrees.com/s/file/preview/274497891/icfp.pdf?pearlId=459776433) - We propose a type system MLF that generalizes ML with first-class polymorphism as in System F. Expressions may contain second- order type annotations. Every typable expression admits a principal type, which however depends on type annotations. Principal types capture all other types that can be obtained by implicit type instan- tiation and they can be inferred. All expressions of ML are well- typed without any annotations. All expressions of System F can be mechanically encoded into MLF by dropping all type abstractions and type applications, and injecting types of lambda-abstractions into MLF types. Moreover, only parameters of lambda-abstractions that are used polymorphically need to remain annotated.

ŒºC++ accomplishes this by providing new kinds of classes: coroutines, which have independent execution states; tasks, which have their own threads; and monitors, which allow for safe communication among tasks. These new classes can take part in inheritance, overloading, and templates, just like other classes. As well, C++ exception handling is extended, allowing exceptions to propagate among coroutines and tasks. Additional capabilities include: clustering of tasks and processors, object-oriented non-blocking I/O for files and sockets, and support for real-time programming. True parallelism is achieved utilizing operating-system kernel-threads. ŒºC++ clarifies and extends object-oriented concurrency providing generality and functionality that surpasses languages like Ada, Java, and C#.

NScript automatically compiles the code into an assembly in memory and executes the assembly. The NScript setup application associates NScript with ".ncs" (for C# scripts), ".nvb" (for VB.NET scripts) and ".njs" (for JScript .NET scripts) file extensions. This enables any code written in these files to be executed directly by double clicking on these files in windows explorer. I wrote this tool when I needed to write a script for automating builds. A simple batch file was not sufficient for the task and I preferred to write code in C# as opposed to VBScript or JScript. This tool came in handy as I could modify the scripts easily and execute them by double clicking on the files in windows explorer.

The semantics of Piccola is defined in terms of a process calculus, an extension of Milner's pi calculus in which values communicated are forms, rather than tuples. A "form" is essentially an extensible nested record which also serves as a namespace in which expressions may be evaluated. This simple mechanism is responsible for much of the expressive power of Piccola.
- [Pico](http://pico.vub.ac.be/welcome.html) - Pico is a tiny but expressive programming language that was especially designed to teach advance computer science concepts to students in other sciences than computer science (such as Physics and Chemistry). In a sense, Pico can be seen as a non-trivial marriage between the power of languages like Scheme, and, the standard infix notation students are used to from ordinary calculus. A.o., Pico features garbage collected tables (i.e. arrays), higher order functions, objects, meta programming and reflection. But above all, Pico is small! Really small!
- [PicoLisp](https://github.com/picolisp/pil21) - PicoLisp is a programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp. Its most prominent features are simplicity and minimalism.

- [Pict](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/pict/Html/Pict.html) - Pict, a concurrent programming language based on the pi-calculus. Pict is a language in the ML tradition, formed by adding a layer of convenient syntactic sugar and a static type system to a tiny core. The current release includes a Pict-to-C compiler, reference manual, language tutorial, numerous libraries, and example programs. The core language - an asynchronous variant of Milner, Parrow, and Walker's pi-calculus - has been used as a theoretical foundation for a broad class of concurrent computations. The goal in Pict is to identify high-level idioms that arise naturally when these primitives are used to build working programs - idioms such as basic data structures, protocols for returning results, higher-order programming, selective communication, and concurrent objects. The type system integrates a number of features found in recent work on theoretical foundations for typed object-oriented languages: higher-order polymorphism, simple recursive types, subtyping, and a powerful partial type inference algorithm.

That makes it ideal for building certain kinds of programs like compilers and virtual machines. It is currently being used for virtual machine and programming language research.
- [Vortex](https://github.com/dibsonthis/Vortex) - Vortex is a language designed to explore links and relationships between entities. It heavily relies on side effects, and as such it would fall under the Dysfunctional Programming paradigm.
- [Vortex](http://projectsweb.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/cecil/www/vortex.html) - Vortex is a language-independent optimizing compiler infrastructure for object-oriented and other high-level languages, written entirely in Cecil. It primarily operates as a whole-program optimizer, performing aggressive analyses and optimizations given the whole program. It has front-ends for Cecil, Diesel, Smalltalk, Java, C++, and Modula-3. These front-ends translate into the Vortex RTL intermediate language. Vortex produces either portable C++ code or SPARC assembly code.
