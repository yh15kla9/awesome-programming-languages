## Contents
# A (44):
- [Adept](https://github.com/AdeptLanguage/Adept) - A blazing fast language for general purpose programming.
- [Alan](https://github.com/alantech/alan) - Alan is a Autoscalable Programming Language:
  - üî≠ Predictable runtime for all computations - A program is represented as DAG(s) where the running time for all computations can be predicted because there is no unbounded recursion or iteration;
  - ‚õì Automatic IO concurrency and parallelism across events and arrays - Alan exploits opportunities for IO concurrency or CPU parallelization across machines in a cluster via arrays and a static event loop without threads, channels, promises, futures, locks, etc;
  - ‚úÖ Almost no runtime errors - No deadlocks, livelocks, undefined variables, divide-by-zero, integer under/overflow, array out-of-bounds access, etc;
  - ‚ö°Ô∏è No GC pauses - Alan‚Äôs runtime manages memory allocation, access, and deallocation for you like Java, Python, or Javascript. However, Alan‚Äôs static event system and automatic event-oriented memory model does so without garbage collector pauses.
- [Alda](https://github.com/alda-lang/alda) - Alda is a text-based programming language for music composition. It allows you to compose and play back music using only your text editor and the command line.
- [Alumina](https://github.com/tibordp/alumina) - Alumina is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language. Alumina is heavily inspired by Rust, especially in terms of syntax and standard library API. Unlike Rust, however, Alumina is not memory-safe and it requires manual memory management.
- [Antimony](https://github.com/antimony-lang/antimony) - Antimony is a general-purpose toy language. Its primary goal is to be simple and easy to understand, not to be efficient.
- [Arturo](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo) - Arturo is an independently-developed, modern programming language, vaguely related to various other ones - including but not limited to Logo, Rebol, Forth, Ruby, Haskell, D, SmallTalk, Tcl, and Lisp. The language has been designed following some very simple and straightforward principles: a) Code is just a list of words and symbols, b) Words and symbols within a block are interpreted - when needed - according to the context, c) No reserved words or keywords - look for them as hard as you can; there are absolutely none.
# B (42):
- [Ballerina](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang) - Ballerina is an open-source programming language for the cloud that makes it easier to use, combine, and create network services.

It has a very small syntax set with a very low learning curve. Blade improves upon the best features of JavaScript, Python, and Ruby to give developers a familiar and powerful system that feels native for developers coming from any of these languages and an easy way to leverage the strength of any.
# C (73):
- [C2](https://github.com/c2lang/c2compiler) - The C2 project attempts to create a new language, strongly based on C. In a nutshell, the main differences with C are:
  - no more header files (too much typing)
  - no includes
  - packages (needed if we can't have includes)
  - compiled per target (not per file)
  - more logical keywords (public/local replaces static)
  - integrated build system
- [C3](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c) - C3 is a C-like language trying to be "an incremental improvement over C" rather than a whole new language.

The purpose of the project is to engineer modern language features into C in an evolutionary rather than revolutionary way. Java is an example of the revolutionary approach of modernizing C/C++, resulting in a new language rather than an extension of its descendents. C++, Fortran 95 and Cobol 9X are examples of the evolutionary approach where modern language features are added and problems fixed within the framework of an existing language.
# D (30):

We're aware of popular semi-OOP languages and we don't think they are good enough, including Java, Ruby, C++, Smalltalk, Python, PHP, C#: all of them have something we don't tolerate. EO is not planning to become a mainstream language-this is not what we want. Our main goal is to prove to ourselves that true object-oriented programming is practically possible. Not just in books and abstract examples, but in real code that works. That's why EO is being created-to put all that "crazy" pure object-oriented ideas into practice and see whether they can work.

It can be viewed as a middle ground between Python, a more complete scripting language with lots of features and libraries, and Lua, a small and compact language that is simple to embed but doesn't provide OOP functionalities out of the box. J* tries to take the best of both worlds, implementing a fully featured class system while maintaining a small standard library and employing the use of a stack based API for communication among the language and host program, rendering embedding simple.

The language also supports bridging to native code written in C, meta-programming with macros, and bytecode assembly.
- [Jank](https://github.com/jank-lang/jank) - Jank is a Clojure dialect which aims to offer the best of both worlds: dynamic and static. For both of these worlds, jank uses a single runtime, so the transition from one to the other is not only seamless, it can be gradual.
